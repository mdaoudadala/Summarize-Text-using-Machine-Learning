## Summarize Text using Machine Learning

Text summarization is the process of compressing a body of text into a concise version, maintaining essential information and the essence of the content. Given the arduous and time-consuming nature of manual text condensation, automated methods are increasingly favored, driving significant interest in academic research. In this article, I'll guide you through the realm of Natural Language Processing for text summarization using Machine Learning techniques.

In the domain of Machine Learning, text summarization finds crucial applications across various Natural Language Processing tasks, including text classification, question answering, legal document synthesis, news synthesis, and headline generation. The aim of text summarization is to produce a precise and coherent summary that encapsulates the main points conveyed in the original document.

### Various types of text summarization approaches

Before delving into the demonstration of text summarization using machine learning and Python, it's essential to grasp the various types of text summarization approaches. Understanding these approaches aids in comprehending the underlying process, allowing for the application of logical reasoning while employing machine learning techniques for text summarization.

Text summarization is typically categorized into two main types: the Extraction Approach and the Abstraction Approach. Let's explore both of these approaches before delving into the coding aspect.


#### The Extraction Approach

The Extractive approach involves selecting sentences directly from the document based on a scoring function to construct a coherent summary. This method functions by identifying the significant sections of the text, extracting and assembling portions of the content to generate a condensed version.


#### The Abstractive Approach

The Abstraction approach seeks to generate a summary by interpreting the text using sophisticated natural language techniques to generate a new, shorter text. This approach may incorporate information not explicitly present in the original document while conveying the most crucial information.


In this task, I will employ the extractive approach to summarize text using Machine Learning and Python. Specifically, I'll utilize the TextRank algorithm, an extractive and unsupervised machine learning algorithm designed for text summarization.
